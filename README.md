Final Project

For my final project I have decided to create a Burlington Police statistical calculator and web mapper using Flask. The site is styled with bootstrap and utilizes Flask's SQL toolkit and ORM (object-relational mapper), SQLAlchemy to store, modify and fetch database records.
It's also protected from SQL injections.
Passwords are salted and hashed with 100,000 iterations of Sha-1.


Modify Records Page should allow user to add, remove, and modify police records from all tables.
Statstics Page should let user choose numerical columns for finding mean, min, max, median, standard deviation mean, on numerical columns. 
c) Allow user to query against any column using WHERE and list sample data. 
d) Allow for 2 queries that require a JOIN. 
e) Allow visualizations for key metrics of your choice with at least two different types of plots.
